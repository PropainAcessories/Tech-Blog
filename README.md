  ## Implementation
  🐔You can implement it by forking or cloning it. Alternatively visit the deployment. If you fork/clone it:

  🐔Run a terminal in the db folder run ```mysql -u root-p``` then after logging in run ```source schema.sql``` and ```SHOW DATABASES``` to make sure forum_db is added.

  🐔 Run ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` to install dependencies.

  🐔 Run ```npm seed``` or ```node seeds/index.js``` to seed the database.

  🐔 Run ```npm start``` or ```node server.js``` to run the application.

  ## Usage
  🐔It is intended to demonstrate a basic forum-based website.
